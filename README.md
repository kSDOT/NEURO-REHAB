# NEURO-REHAB
Project for Neuro-Rehab course. VR application that aims to help with rehabilitation of users that have poor motor skills. This approach is different from traditional approaches because: 
1. It is automated way and requires no medical assistant. 
2. It can be performed at home with off the shelf equipment.
To play this game, the user first needs to select the limbs that suffers from poor motor skills. After that, bubbles will be shot at the user selected limbs, and they must try to dodge them. 
To achieve this we have combined the capabilities of VR with a depth-sensing camera (kinect 2) and fused the info from this sensors to provide an immersive experience.
